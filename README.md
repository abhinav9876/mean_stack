# Application

=>MongoDB stores user account information and persists sessions (so that a server crash does not log out all users.)

=>Express functions Node.js middleware to handle all HTTP requests and routing.

=>Angular handles HTML templating and data manipulation.

=>Node.js is the runtime for the application.

To run the server:

$ npm install -g nodemon

$ nodemon server.js
